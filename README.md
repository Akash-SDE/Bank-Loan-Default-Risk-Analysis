# Bank Loan Default Risk Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the risk of default on bank loans using Python. The analysis is conducted in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging various data analysis and machine learning libraries.

# Overview
The project aims to:

1.Explore and understand the dataset related to bank loans.
2.Preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
3.Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
4.Build machine learning models to predict loan default risk.
5.Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and techniques.
6.Provide recommendations or insights based on the analysis.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about bank loans, including attributes such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower's credit score, employment status, and loan status (default or non-default).

# Tools and Libraries
1.Python
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Pandas
4.NumPy
5.Matplotlib
6.Seaborn

# Usage
To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3.Open the Jupyter Notebook file Bank_Loan_Default_Risk_Analysis.ipynb.
4.Execute the cells in the notebook to perform data analysis and build models.

# Results
The analysis reveals insights into the factors influencing loan default risk and the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting default.

# Conclusion
Based on the analysis, certain factors such as credit score, loan amount, and employment status significantly impact the likelihood of loan default. Machine learning models can be used to predict default risk with reasonable accuracy, providing valuable insights for risk assessment and decision-making in the banking sector.
